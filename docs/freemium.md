### **Freemium Model with Certification Badge Integration**

#### **1. Freemium Model Overview**

- **Free Tier** (B2C):
  - **Brand Legitimacy Scanning**: Consumers can check if a brand is legit by using basic scanning features (e.g., checking for obvious red flags, negative reviews, and basic trust metrics).
  - **Basic Brand Info**: Provide free access to high-level information like the brand’s reviews, website security status, and basic legitimacy rating (e.g., “Trustworthy,” “Suspicious”).
  - **Limited Search**: Allow a limited number of brand checks per month (e.g., 3–5 free scans).
  - **Basic Reporting**: Offer a basic legitimacy report without in-depth analysis or advanced metrics.

- **Paid Tier** (B2B + B2C):
  - **Full Legitimacy Report**: Includes advanced details, such as deeper insights into customer reviews, history of any complaints, product certifications, business registration checks, etc.
  - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of a brand’s reputation, including real-time alerts if something goes wrong (negative reviews, scam reports, etc.).
  - **Brand Trust Score**: A detailed numerical score or rating representing the brand's legitimacy, based on a mix of criteria (reviews, certifications, complaints, etc.).
  - **Certification Badge**: The main feature for brand owners, where brands that meet the legitimacy criteria can earn a **Trustworthy Brand Badge** to display on their website, marketing materials, and social media.

#### **2. Certification Badge Offering (For B2B)**

- **Free Plan (B2C)**:
  - **No Badge Access**: Consumers can check if a brand is legitimate, but they won't have the ability to earn or access the badge themselves. This allows them to validate their purchase decisions, which builds trust in your platform.
  
- **Paid Plan (B2B)**:
  - **Badge Access**: Brand owners and marketers who subscribe to the paid plans can apply for the certification badge. This is the core value-add for businesses, as the badge boosts their credibility and provides external validation of their trustworthiness.
  - **Eligibility**: Brands must meet certain **legitimacy criteria** to qualify for the badge (e.g., good reviews, no reported fraud, transparency in business practices).
  - **Customizable Badge**: For larger brands or premium subscribers, offer options to customize the badge design (e.g., logo placement, color schemes, and text).
  - **Continuous Badge Monitoring**: Brands can maintain their badge as long as they remain compliant with the legitimacy standards. If something goes wrong, the badge could be revoked or downgraded.
  - **High-Visibility Marketing**: The badge serves as an excellent marketing tool. Brands can showcase the badge on:
    - **Websites**: Homepages, product pages, checkout flows.
    - **Email Campaigns**: To assure customers about their trustworthiness.
    - **Social Media**: Promoted as part of a customer reassurance strategy.

#### **3. Monetization Strategy**

- **Free Plan (B2C)**: 
  - **Limited Features for Consumers**: Consumers can use the basic scanning features to check a brand’s legitimacy but cannot access the certification badge feature. This helps build trust in your tool and encourages them to promote it through word-of-mouth.
  - **Advertising (Optional)**: Display ads or sponsored content for related services (e.g., e-commerce tools, legal services, etc.) within the free plan dashboard.

- **Paid Plan (B2B)**:
  - **Subscription Fee**: Brand owners pay a recurring subscription fee to access premium features and certification badges. Pricing tiers can be adjusted based on the brand’s size or needs.
    - **Basic Plan**: $49–$199/month — Includes up to 10 badge verifications per month, access to full reports, basic real-time monitoring.
    - **Pro Plan**: $200–$500/month — Unlimited badge verifications, advanced analytics, real-time alerts, and dedicated account support.
    - **Enterprise Plan**: Custom pricing — Tailored solutions with customizable badge designs, priority support, and additional integrations.
  
- **One-Time Certification Fee**: 
  - For brands who don’t want a recurring subscription, offer a one-time payment option to receive a badge after passing a legitimacy test. The one-time fee can be higher (e.g., **$499–$999** for certification and the badge issuance).
